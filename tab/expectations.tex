       S1  &  Yes. One of the main reasons for me to join the course was to learn how to contribute to free software. 
       \\
       S2 & Yes, I really enjoyed it. They were very dynamic and flexible.
       \\
       S3 & My objective in the course was to acquire more knowledge about OSS projects. In this sense, it met my expectations.
       \\
       S7 & Yes, but I imagined there would be more hands-on activities. \\
       S9 & Yes. The course managed to meet what I expected from it, which was to contribute to an open source project and get me started in the open source universe.
       \\
       S11 & Yes. The course surprised me in a very positive way. I overcame my fear of interacting and proposing solutions in OSS projects.
       \\
       S12  & Yes. However, if the project was internal to the class, it would have been better.\\
